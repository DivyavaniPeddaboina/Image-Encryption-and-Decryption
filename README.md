# Image-Encryption-and-Decryption
This Java Swing application provides a simple method for encrypting and decrypting image files using the XOR operation. It allows users to select an image, input a numeric key, and encrypt/decrypt the image by applying a bitwise XOR operation. Running the program with the same key restores the original image.

Features
User-friendly GUI using Java Swing
Encrypts and decrypts images using XOR bitwise operation
Select any image file using JFileChooser
Prevents errors with input validation & exception handling
Efficient file processing with buffered streams
